## Paper abstract

Determining the molecule-surface adsorption energy *E*<sub>ads</sub> from first-principles is pivotal to predict technologically-relevant phenomena such as reaction rates in catalysis. Here, the prototypical molecule-surface system to validate first-principles methods has long been CO on MgO. However, to date, there is no consensus on its *E*<sub>ads</sub>, with theory and experiments yielding a wide range of values. In this work, we tackle this problem by leveraging the latest advances in diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and coupled cluster theory \[CCSD(T)\] to obtain accurate predictions of the CO on MgO *E*<sub>ads</sub>. With this effort, we are able to close the chapter on this long-debated problem, reaching agreement in the *E*<sub>ads</sub> between DMC, CCSD(T) and experiment. Now, this consensus between theory and experiment sets the stage for their combined integration in future work to reveal detailed insights into important catalytic processes for a range of surfaces and molecules.
